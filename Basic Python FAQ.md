## What is the "shebang" line in Python? or What is the use of shebang line in python?
This is shebang line **#!/usr/bin/python**
This is used when you are using python in Unix environment.
This will notify Linux/Unix the path of python.
There is no use of this line in the window's environment but it is good to know that. 

## Why we use if __name__ == 'Main()': in our python program?
This line name==maine checks if this is the main running script. We use this line when we import some module.
Because importing module means running the importing module's code prior to your code.
