## *Basics about MQTT* 

### MQTT is called as MQ Telemetry Transport. 
Earlier it was called as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. But as there is no option queue in the MQTT protocol.So we now refer it as MQ Telemetry Transport.

MQTT is a lightweight protocol to publish or subscribe messaging between to machines. It follows M2M(machine to machine) communication. 

MQTT is becoming one of the main protocols for IOT (internet of things) deployments in couple of years.This is a protocol based on the TV and Radio broadcasting techniques in which we don't know if anybody or client actually listening to the broadcast. 


### MQTT Versions 
    1) MQTT-> It has various released versions  for example MQTT v3.1 and MQTT v5. This kind of version used for TCP/IP networks.
    2) MQTT-SN -> This version is not much popular. It specified around 2013. It is designed to work over UDP, ZigBee supported transport.
       If you have some network which use Zigbee standard then you can use this protocol.
