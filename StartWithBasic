# My Environment
  1) Windows 10 
  2) Python 3.5.1
Note: Commands or steps can differ in case of the different environment than mine.  

# Verify the Python Version installed on your machine
  1) Open CMD or PowerShell
  2) Type Python
  3) You will get the Python version and other information about interpreter as an example 
  Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:38:48) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  4) You can exit from this command line by typing "exit()"
Note: In case you didn't get the Python version then most probably the window's path is not set in the in the environment variable of the system. In this case 
Please follow the official document https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html.
 
# How to Comment the code?
Clean code is the best code. Always try to comment on the most important features in your code or use name convention wisely. 
Example:
 *Single Line Comment* "# Hello Pythonic guys"
 *Multi Line Comment*  """Line1 Hi,This is how we comment in multiple line. Python
                        Line 2 is extremly fun language """
