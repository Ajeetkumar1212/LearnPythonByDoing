## SQLite databases with Python Programming

### **About**

1) Using SQLite in your python programs is very easy and convenient. 
2) As per official document of Python3 "https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html"
SQLite is basically a C library which provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesn’t require a separate server process like the old traditional database.
It also allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. 
Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.
